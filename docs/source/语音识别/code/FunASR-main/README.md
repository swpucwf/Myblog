## Highlights
- FunASR is a fundamental speech recognition toolkit that offers a variety of features, including speech recognition (ASR), Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Punctuation Restoration, Language Models, Speaker Verification, Speaker Diarization and multi-talker ASR. FunASR provides convenient scripts and tutorials, supporting inference and fine-tuning of pre-trained models.
- We have released a vast collection of academic and industrial pretrained models on the [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models?page=1&tasks=auto-speech-recognition) and [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/FunASR), which can be accessed through our [Model Zoo](https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/FunASR/blob/main/docs/model_zoo/modelscope_models.md). The representative [Paraformer-large](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch/summary), a non-autoregressive end-to-end speech recognition model, has the advantages of high accuracy, high efficiency, and convenient deployment, supporting the rapid construction of speech recognition services. For more details on service deployment, please refer to the [service deployment document](runtime/readme_cn.md).

## Quick Start
Quick start for new usersÔºà[tutorial](https://alibaba-damo-academy.github.io/FunASR/en/funasr/quick_start.html)Ôºâ

FunASR supports inference and fine-tuning of models trained on industrial data for tens of thousands of hours. For more details, please refer to [modelscope_egs](https://alibaba-damo-academy.github.io/FunASR/en/modelscope_pipeline/quick_start.html). It also supports training and fine-tuning of models on academic standard datasets. For more information, please refer to [egs](https://alibaba-damo-academy.github.io/FunASR/en/academic_recipe/asr_recipe.html).

Below is a quick start tutorial. Test audio files ([Mandarin](https://isv-data.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/ics/MaaS/ASR/test_audio/vad_example.wav), [English]()).

### Command-line usage

```shell
funasr --model paraformer-zh asr_example_zh.wav
```

Notes: Support recognition of single audio file, as well as file list in Kaldi-style wav.scp format: `wav_id wav_pat`

### Speech Recognition (Non-streaming)
```python
from funasr import infer

p = infer(model="paraformer-zh", vad_model="fsmn-vad", punc_model="ct-punc", model_hub="ms")

res = p("asr_example_zh.wav", batch_size_token=5000)
print(res)
```
Note: `model_hub`: represents the model repository, `ms` stands for selecting ModelScope download, `hf` stands for selecting Huggingface download.

### Speech Recognition (Streaming)
```python
from funasr import infer

p = infer(model="paraformer-zh-streaming", model_hub="ms")

chunk_size = [0, 10, 5] #[0, 10, 5] 600ms, [0, 8, 4] 480ms
param_dict = {"cache": dict(), "is_final": False, "chunk_size": chunk_size, "encoder_chunk_look_back": 4, "decoder_chunk_look_back": 1}

import torchaudio
speech = torchaudio.load("asr_example_zh.wav")[0][0]
speech_length = speech.shape[0]

stride_size = chunk_size[1] * 960
sample_offset = 0
for sample_offset in range(0, speech_length, min(stride_size, speech_length - sample_offset)):
    param_dict["is_final"] = True if sample_offset + stride_size >= speech_length - 1 else False
    input = speech[sample_offset: sample_offset + stride_size]
    rec_result = p(input=input, param_dict=param_dict)
    print(rec_result)
```
Note: `chunk_size` is the configuration for streaming latency.` [0,10,5]` indicates that the real-time display granularity is `10*60=600ms`, and the lookahead information is `5*60=300ms`. Each inference input is `600ms` (sample points are `16000*0.6=960`), and the output is the corresponding text. For the last speech segment input, `is_final=True` needs to be set to force the output of the last word.

Quick start for new users can be found in [docs](https://alibaba-damo-academy.github.io/FunASR/en/funasr/quick_start_zh.html)
